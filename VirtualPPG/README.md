# Virtual PPG

Implement a real-time virtual heart rate sensor, also called virtual PPG, using opencv. 
In this module, we implement a heart rate sensor from scratch using image processing tools and a simple camera. 
We will use this case study to get an overview of all the steps required to do image analysis and dive deep into a specific application. 
When you are able to measure your heart rate in real-time using your camera, you can connect this biomedical information to any other device or application.
