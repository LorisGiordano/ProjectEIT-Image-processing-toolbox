# Tracking

Recognize hand gestures and faces using opencv and mediapipe. 
In this module, we dive deeper into the recognition of humans in images so that they can interact with computers. 
We will understand how our computer can understand human attributes like hands and faces and how we can optimize this to interact with our computer in real time. 
We will look at the fastest and most powerful machine-learning models that are used for these tasks and learn how to process an image using those tools. 
What we can do with these results is up to you.

### 3D tracking

Track a region of interest in 3 dimensions using a depth camera.
Investiage how depth sensing works and how to track regions of interest over time using Kalman filters.

### ORB tracking

Track similar objects in a image using a efficient ORB algorithm.
Go in depth in the feature keypoints and derived descriptors that allow ORB to quickly find objects in images.

### Simple tracking

Explore different simple methods for object tracking implemented by Opencv.
Dive into the logic of the different methods and elect the best method for your application.
