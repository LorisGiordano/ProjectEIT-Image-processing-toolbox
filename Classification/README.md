# Classification module

Train your own classifiers using scikit-learn. 
In this module, we will learn more about machine learning: what models are, how models can learn from data, and how we can use machine learning models to perform almost any task. 
Collect your own dataset and use it to train your own model to classify different inputs. 
What you do with the classification results afterward is only limited by your imagination.

### Trees

Discover one of the simplest and most powerful machine learning models: the classification trees.
Learn about machine learning and uncover all the secrets of classification trees and derived algorithms.
